1. We tried creating our own CNN model at first, which wasnt giving much high of an accuracy, so we moved on to Transfer Learning.
2. We had a couple of choices ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet. Im this particular model, we used MobileNet.
3. The rest of the steps were pretty simple, first I seperated the data into train and val. Since we had 80 images for each class, I made a 70-10 split, just to test the waters. After that I preprocessed the data, using the basic data_preprocessing function.
4. The input size is (224,224,3) for this model, but can be changed depending on the output we get.
5. Finally, after compilation and making sure our model doesn't overfit, I saved it in "my_model_weights.h5"
6. Then used that saved model to in the test file.
